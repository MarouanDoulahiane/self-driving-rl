# self-driving-rl
A reinforcement learning project where a Q-learning agent learns to drive a 2D car in a custom-built simulator. The goal is for the agent to navigate through a simple environment by maximizing rewards through trial and error, providing hands-on experience with RL in a self-driving context.
